This repository contains all the work I completed in 'CS:330-ComputerOrganization&AssemblyLang' at The University of Alabama at Birmingham.
In this course I studied how a computer works and how it process information from start to finish. We did a good bit of programming in C and dabbled a little 
into Assembly Language. Asgn2-4 are written completely in C, while asgn6 is converting C to Assembly, and asgn7 in purely written in Assembly Language.
